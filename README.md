## Introduction

ML Chat Agent provides an infrastructure that allows users to interact with machine learning models through natural language. Leveraging the Gemini framework, this project aims to make ML models accessible and usable as products through a conversational interface. This project leverages Cell2Cell Telecom Public churn dataset available from Kaggle. With the xgboost model build on this dataset a chatbot is created that will let users ask questions to Xgboost Model and data infra in English and get the answer they look for. Some of the tools users can leverage is asking for reasons for churn, impact analysis, individual recommendation, vizualization etc
